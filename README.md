# password-generator
This project is to create an application that generates a random password based on the user's selected criteria. 

The user is first presented with a series of prompts to determine password criteria. 

The password length must be between 8 and 128 characters. The user is then asked to confirm lowercase, uppercase, numeric and or special characters. 

The password is then generated from the selected critera and written to the page.
